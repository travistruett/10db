# apps/desktop

The 10db window: React 19 + Mantine 9 UI built by Vite, inside a Tauri 2 shell (`src-tauri/`).
The UI never touches the database; it talks to the daemon over loopback HTTP and WebSocket.

- Daemon calls go through `src/daemon/client.ts` (Hono typed client over `AppType`). Never
  hand-write a fetch to the daemon.
- Server state lives in TanStack Query; routes are code-based TanStack Router in `src/router.tsx`.
- Mantine components and theme tokens only; see `DESIGN.md`. Use the Mantine MCP server for
  component docs (pinned to our Mantine version).
- Dark by default; every view must work in light mode too.
- The React Compiler is on; don't hand-write `useMemo`/`useCallback` for render performance.
- Tests: Testing Library + MSW. Hit the daemon URL through MSW, never a real daemon.
- Rust in `src-tauri/`: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` with pedantic lints.
